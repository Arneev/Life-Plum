# Life-Plum

Life Plum is meant to be opened once you start the day.

It is meant to track your "happiness" based on how you feeling each morning.
You can see how you have been feeling over the past few days, weeks, month and years.

You can also journal down or plan your day and check them out on a later date if you wish.

A 2 minute check up everyday on Life Plum!
